Great question ‚Äî **Consumer Proposals** and **Debt Management Plans (DMPs)** are both tools to help people get out of debt, but they are **very different** in how they work, how they affect your credit, and who qualifies.

Let‚Äôs break it down side by side to help you decide.

### üîç **Quick Comparison:**

| Feature                     | **Consumer Proposal**                                                                            | **Debt Management Plan (DMP)**                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What is it?**             | A **legal process** under federal law that reduces your debt (you only pay part of what you owe) | An **informal agreement** to repay 100% of your debt, but often with **reduced interest** |
| **Who manages it?**         | A **Licensed Insolvency Trustee (LIT)**                                                          | A **Credit Counselling Agency**                                                           |
| **How much do you repay?**  | Typically **30‚Äì60%** of your total debt (rest is forgiven)                                       | **100% of your debt** ‚Äî but often with **0% or reduced interest**                         |
| **Monthly payment**         | Lower than your current one (based on what you can afford)                                       | May be similar to what you're paying now, just with no or lower interest                  |
| **Interest**                | **Frozen immediately**                                                                           | Usually **lowered or eliminated** (e.g., credit cards may go to 0%)                       |
| **Credit impact**           | Serious: **R7** rating on credit report for 3 years after completion                             | Moderate: **R7** rating during repayment (removed 2 years after completion)               |
| **Legal protection**        | Yes ‚Äî creditors **must stop** collections and lawsuits                                           | No legal protection ‚Äî **voluntary**, so creditors can opt out                             |
| **Time to complete**        | Up to **5 years**                                                                                | Usually **3‚Äì5 years**                                                                     |
| **Includes CRA/tax debt?**  | ‚úÖ Yes                                                                                            | ‚ùå No                                                                                      |
| **Includes student loans?** | ‚úÖ Yes (if over 7 years old)                                                                      | ‚ùå No                                                                                      |

### ü§î **Which One Is Better for You?**

Here‚Äôs how to decide:

#### ‚úÖ **Choose a Consumer Proposal if:**

* You **can‚Äôt realistically repay** the full amount you owe
* You want **legal protection** from creditors
* You have **CRA debt** or old student loans
* You want a **fresh start** and lower monthly payments

#### ‚úÖ **Choose a Debt Management Plan if:**

* You **can afford** to repay 100% of the debt with some interest relief
* Your debts are mostly **high-interest credit cards**
* You want to **avoid legal proceedings**
* Your **credit is still in decent shape** and you want to protect it more

---

### üß† Based on **your current situation**:

* You owe **\$58,000+**
* Most of it is high-interest credit card debt (13.99%‚Äì26.99%)
* You're currently paying about **\$805/month**
* You already have a **low-interest LOC (7.44%)** available
* You're considering **consolidation**

‚û°Ô∏è **A Debt Management Plan** may not save you that much, since you already have a **lower-interest option (the LOC)** and can avoid paying 100% of the debt at full price.

‚û°Ô∏è A **Consumer Proposal** could be useful **if your LOC isn‚Äôt an option anymore** (maxed out, closed, or unaffordable) ‚Äî and you can‚Äôt keep up.

---

### ‚úÖ My Suggestion:

* **If you still qualify for your LOC**, use it to consolidate and **pay aggressively** (e.g. \$800‚Äì\$1000/month).
* If that‚Äôs **no longer realistic** ‚Äî talk to a **Licensed Insolvency Trustee** for a **free consultation** about a **Consumer Proposal**.
* A **Debt Management Plan** is probably your **least effective** option here (since it still repays 100% of the debt).

(I told it about Line of Credit increase but it would increase interest rate)  
  
Thanks ‚Äî this new info changes the picture quite a bit. Let's walk through what this means and re-evaluate whether it's better to:

1. **Expand your Line of Credit (LOC)** at 11.99% to consolidate everything, or
2. **Consider a Consumer Proposal**, or
3. Stick with your **current payments and LOC**.

---

## üîÅ **Updated Scenario with New LOC Terms**

### If you consolidate **all \$58,020.99** onto an expanded LOC at **11.99% interest**:

| Monthly Payment | Time to Payoff          | Total Interest Paid |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| \$800           | \~9 years (108 months)  | \~\$47,000          |
| \$900           | \~7.5 years (91 months) | \~\$39,000          |
| \$1,000         | \~6.5 years (79 months) | \~\$33,000          |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Big difference vs. the original 7.44% LOC** ‚Äî you're now paying thousands more in interest, even with higher payments.

---

### üìä **Compare to Staying on Credit Cards + Current LOC**

If you stay with your:

* 13.99% Visa (\$15K)
* 26.99% Tim's & Walmart (\$17.8K combined)
* 7.44% LOC (\$24.7K)

... and pay \$805/month, you‚Äôll still likely:

* Take **15‚Äì17 years** to pay it all off
* Pay **\$90,000‚Äì\$100,000+** in total interest

So, even the **11.99% consolidated LOC** saves you money and time **if you can afford to pay \$800‚Äì\$1,000/month**.

---

## üí° **Now Let‚Äôs Compare to a Consumer Proposal**

Let‚Äôs assume a Licensed Insolvency Trustee negotiates a proposal where you repay **\~40%** of your \$58,000 balance = **\$23,200**.

| Monthly Payment | Time to Payoff      | Interest                 | Credit Rating Impact            |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| \~\$387         | 60 months (5 years) | \$0 (interest is frozen) | R7 for 3 years after completion |

‚û°Ô∏è If approved, you‚Äôd save **\~\$35,000 in principal** and all interest.
‚û°Ô∏è The tradeoff: your **credit score drops** (temporarily), and it shows as a public record.

## ‚úÖ Recommendation Summary

| Option                   | Total Cost                             | Pros                                      | Cons                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Expand LOC to 11.99%** | \~\$80K (with \$800‚Äì\$900/mo payments) | Keeps credit score, simple repayment      | Higher interest than ideal, long payoff |
| **Consumer Proposal**    | \~\$23K‚Äì\$30K                          | Huge savings, frozen interest, fixed term | Credit hit (R7), legal filing           |
| **Do nothing**           | \$100K+                                | No changes                                | Highest cost, years of stress           |

## üß† Bottom Line

If:

* You can‚Äôt get a low-interest consolidation loan
* And you want a clean, affordable, fast way out

üëâ **A Consumer Proposal is likely your best move**.

It‚Äôs the only path that:

* Slashes your debt
* Stops interest immediately
* Gives you a fixed monthly payment and debt-free date
